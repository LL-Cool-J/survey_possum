#SurveyPossum

Because you're tired of SurveyMonkey.

###Signup

Visit [SurveyPossum](http://ll-cool-j.herokuapp.com/) and signup with your name
and e-mail address.  Get unlimited access to create as many surveys as you want,
as long as you only like free response or yes/no questions.  Multiple choice will
cost you extra.

Also, your survey-takers should be forewarned: required questions are REALLY required--
if they're left unanswered, all the rest of their responses will be wiped out. Maybe
we'll fix that for SurveyPossum 1.0.1

###Have a look around

If you prefer to test-drive SurveyPossum before committing your precious e-mail
address to an account, here's a sample login and password:

User: `ll@coolj.com`

Password: `llcoolj`

*(Created by Lindsey & Lee (Front End), and Joe (Rails)...aka LL-Cool-J)*
